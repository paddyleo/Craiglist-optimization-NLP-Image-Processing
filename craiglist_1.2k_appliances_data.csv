My nephew used these food carts for 2 years Summer and Fall before he moved. The cart is a used Taco Bell Stainless Steel Food cart. He put his own custom Menu signs over the Taco Logo's He moved the food cart and an ice-cream cart (sold separately) on a small used trailer he bought on Craigslist for $250. He took the trailer to Colorado when he moved there last year. If you plan to move the food cart you need to get a trailer if you don't have one.Chris earned $350-500 per day around the green, on Long Wharf and at events in and around New Haven during the Spring, Summer and Fall selling barbecue, grilled and steamed hot food like grilled and steamed hot dogs and burgers, pre-prepared steak sandwiches (kept hot in the carts steamer trays), pre-prepared cold subs (kept cold in the carts cooler, hot coffee and donuts kept hot in the cart, and cold beverages (he used a large cooler - not included), and an endless list of snacks including pre-prepared hot popcorn (kept hot in the carts steam tray) hot and cold beverages and snacks.What I am selling for Chris is the the 2 used carts. A Taco Bell"" stainless steel cart for $695 and an Ice-cream cart for $495. Nothing else. The prices are firm (Chris paid $2900 just for the food cart. You get to add any other component like a portable grill, umbrella, Menu Signs, etc. All the photos in this ad are to provide design ideas. Only the Taco Bell photo depicts the actual food cart being sold. Look at the other photos for ideas but remember I am only selling the used stainless steel food cart (1st photo) an an ice-cream cart.

We got rid of the tenants, so we don't need this fridge. In the last few years we've just kept frozen meats and adult beverages in it. What you see is what you get.It's a pretty basic fridge, it keeps food cold. It's missing some things that do not affect it from cooling food-Missing--The pull out drawers (2 on fridge side, 1 on freezer side)-The pull out bucket for ice (it held ice and crushed ice cubes. The motor still works for crushing ice if you get a new bucket)- The tray that sides under to catch condensation (now & then drips on floor, but it was in the garage so it didn't matter, it was just concrete. I wouldn't put it on wood floors without finding a new tray)Other than those missing parts, I don't know anything else about it.  I put in beers and ice cream, and they stayed cold. So it does what it is supposed to do. GREAT DEAL for a spare refrigerator to keep in the garage for extra kitchen food, holiday left overs that the family left for you deal with or if you are just a college student with not much money left over after all the books. ;)It is about 31.5"" wide by 30"" deep by 67"" tall.If you want to check it out, just email your contact information and I call or text you to set up a time and give directions.Thank you for looking.",$75,NA

Like new Kenmore French Door (top Side by Side, bottom freezer) stainless steel fridge, water/ice in the door. Works great, only used for a couple of months, just freshly cleaned and polished.The story is simple…bought a new fridge back when we rented a home near the college. Were forced to move due to landlord selling the place out from under us with no warning. Ultimately we ended up buying this new home where we are, and the home came with all Maytag Appliances so we don’t need this…tried listing it but then covid and lockdowns and everything happened. It’s just been sitting in the garage helping gravity hold down the cement lol joking…but it has been just sitting there collecting dust. I placed it near the outlet so we can plug it in and show you it works. It comes with the filter box so you know the filter number to replace and a hose for the water hookup. Serious buyers only. Do NOT attempt to pull any scams, don’t have time for it. NO CHECKS!! CASH ONLY!!!I do have a truck and would help deliver it however, unfortunately my truck needs brakes and a fuel pump…typical of everything braking at the same time, I recommend NEVER buying a Titan (though unless used you can’t anyway because they’ve been discontinued…hmm wonder why??!? Pieces of junk is what they are and cost a fortune to fix…but with this chip shortage, we gotta wait to replace our vehicles until the auto market stabilizes, maybe 2023) so we gotta sell this fridge so I can afford to fix my truck. It’s a great fridge, considering it is basically barely used and practically new, you’re getting this $3200 fridge for a steal at $1200, that’s 1/3 the price (after factoring in tax)","$1,200",like new

My nephew used these food carts for 2 years Summer and Fall before he moved. The cart is a used Taco Bell Stainless Steel Food cart. He put his own custom Menu signs over the Taco Logo's He moved the food cart and an ice-cream cart (sold separately) on a small used trailer he bought on Craigslist for $250. He took the trailer to Colorado when he moved there last year. If you plan to move the food cart you need to get a trailer if you don't have one.Chris earned $350-500 per day around the green, on Long Wharf and at events in and around New Haven during the Spring, Summer and Fall selling barbecue, grilled and steamed hot food like grilled and steamed hot dogs and burgers, pre-prepared steak sandwiches (kept hot in the carts steamer trays), pre-prepared cold subs (kept cold in the carts cooler, hot coffee and donuts kept hot in the cart, and cold beverages (he used a large cooler - not included), and an endless list of snacks including pre-prepared hot popcorn (kept hot in the carts steam tray) hot and cold beverages and snacks.What I am selling for Chris is the the 2 used carts. A Taco Bell"" stainless steel cart for $695 and an Ice-cream cart for $495. Nothing else. The prices are firm (Chris paid $2900 just for the food cart. You get to add any other component like a portable grill, umbrella, Menu Signs, etc. All the photos in this ad are to provide design ideas. Only the Taco Bell photo depicts the actual food cart being sold. Look at the other photos for ideas but remember I am only selling the used stainless steel food cart (1st photo) an an ice-cream cart. The You get to customize the carts to look like anything you can imagine using readily available light weight materials available from Lowes and Home Depot.-As the posting says, I'm also selling Chris's used Ice-cream cart. My son used dry ice to keep ice-cream, Italian ice, yogurt and other frozen delights frozen for days on-end. Though this cart has a 120V cooler, the thermostat is broken.

While the heater is efficient, it is also safe. The unit will automatically shut off when the heater is tipped over when active, and a loud buzzer goes off to warn you that it has fallen over.

Big-box stores allow customers to return or reject appliances for many different reasons. Sometimes appliances get a ding or a dent during installation or delivery. Sometimes appliances are the wrong color, brand, size, or another reason that did not meet the customer’s expectations.
