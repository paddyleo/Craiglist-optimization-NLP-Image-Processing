We got rid of the tenants, so we don't need this fridge. In the last few years we've just kept frozen meats and adult beverages in it. What you see is what you get.It's a pretty basic fridge, it keeps food cold. It's missing some things that do not affect it from cooling food-Missing--The pull out drawers (2 on fridge side, 1 on freezer side)-The pull out bucket for ice (it held ice and crushed ice cubes. The motor still works for crushing ice if you get a new bucket)- The tray that sides under to catch condensation (now & then drips on floor, but it was in the garage so it didn't matter, it was just concrete. I wouldn't put it on wood floors without finding a new tray)Other than those missing parts, I don't know anything else about it.  I put in beers and ice cream, and they stayed cold. So it does what it is supposed to do. GREAT DEAL for a spare refrigerator to keep in the garage for extra kitchen food, holiday left overs that the family left for you deal with or if you are just a college student with not much money left over after all the books. ;)It is about 31.5"" wide by 30"" deep by 67"" tall.If you want to check it out, just email your contact information and I call or text you to set up a time and give directions.Thank you for looking.",$75,NA

Like new Kenmore French Door (top Side by Side, bottom freezer) stainless steel fridge, water/ice in the door. Works great, only used for a couple of months, just freshly cleaned and polished.The story is simpleâ¦bought a new fridge back when we rented a home near the college. Were forced to move due to landlord selling the place out from under us with no warning. Ultimately we ended up buying this new home where we are, and the home came with all Maytag Appliances so we donât need thisâ¦tried listing it but then covid and lockdowns and everything happened. Itâs just been sitting in the garage helping gravity hold down the cement lol jokingâ¦but it has been just sitting there collecting dust. I placed it near the outlet so we can plug it in and show you it works. It comes with the filter box so you know the filter number to replace and a hose for the water hookup. Serious buyers only. Do NOT attempt to pull any scams, donât have time for it. NO CHECKS!! CASH ONLY!!!I do have a truck and would help deliver it however, unfortunately my truck needs brakes and a fuel pumpâ¦typical of everything braking at the same time, I recommend NEVER buying a Titan (though unless used you canât anyway because theyâve been discontinuedâ¦hmm wonder why??!? Pieces of junk is what they are and cost a fortune to fixâ¦but with this chip shortage, we gotta wait to replace our vehicles until the auto market stabilizes, maybe 2023) so we gotta sell this fridge so I can afford to fix my truck. Itâs a great fridge, considering it is basically barely used and practically new, youâre getting this $3200 fridge for a steal at $1200, thatâs 1/3 the price (after factoring in tax)","$1,200",like new
